## Overview
Cash register simulator

This is a register simulator for the fictional company QuickStop.  To use this program you can either launch it in your mac terminal or with the Eclipse IDE.  The user is asked to enter the price of the item the customer wishes to purchase. They are then asked to enter the amount of money provided by the customer. The program will either calculate the required change or notify the user that the tendered amount is not enough to cover the price for purchase.

## Technologies/Skills Used

*Mac
*Java
*Eclipse
*ZSH
*Git

This program was written in Java in the Eclipse IDE. The finished code was then pushed to a Github respoistory using Git on a Mac ZSH terminal. The program uses a do while loop with a boolean variable to keep the program running to simulate a cash register.  The user is asked to enter the price of the item and the amount tendered by the customer.  Using logic operators in a series of if statements, the change amount is caluclated and displayed, or the user is notified that the amount tendered is not enough for the purschase.

Change is provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used are not displayed. This was accomplished with basic java arthimatic operations and logic statements.


## Lessons Learned

Managing input and output usinf scanner. how to manage mulitple variables using different datatypes to collect input from the user and calculate an outout. This includes using the printf() method to formate the output. Using the Math.round method to keep change at 2 decmial points. Casting variables as either double or integers when nesscary so that armatic operations can be performed with desired output, as necessary.
